# Data-Prep_Agent
This project preprocess an uploaded csv data file. Many kaggle challenges involve simple data preprocessing to enable further machine learning processing. This agent streamlines the process of such preprocessing and codes in a Jupyter Notebook which the user can use directly to add more machine learning frameworks.
